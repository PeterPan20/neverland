CSS stands for Casscading Style Sheets.

CSS Format:
CSS has 3 different formats. The first is by making a class with it's own 
unigue name. This is same as making a variable in Javascript. Inside the brackets
is the atteributes that desgins your page. 

.name_of_class {
	atteributes of the class
}

The second way is by directly putting the name of an HTML tag. For example
if you put "table" as done below, your CSS for "table" will apply to every
table in your HTML code. 

table {
	atteributes of the class
}

The third way is using a hashtag. The hashtag calls an ID. For example if one 
of your HTML tags has an ID called "Gradient", as shown below, every tag with the
ID of "Gradinet" will be whatever you put inside the brackets. 

#Gradient {
	atteributes of the class
}
