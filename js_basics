variable=things stored inside a "box".e.g. var name="anish"; or let name="anish" and you can also use this variable at a later time.
let=another way of writing var
parameter=variables passed to a function as additional information. e.g.type of cookie can be passed as a parameter and to make the cookie can be the function
alert=alert is a function that makes a message to pop up on the screen. It takes the message to be displayed as a parameter
alert e.g. alert("Hello World! How Are You?");
 alert can be used for  2 pourposes 
 1.giving a mesage to the user 
 2.debuging code to till what line the code got executed.
 To find the place till where the code is getting executed you have to place multipel alerts.alternetivly console.log can be used so yuo dont have to remove the debuging statments.
prompt = prompt is a function to get infromation from what a user, typed in in the text box and it can be used in a variable.
function = a set of instructions that u can save for later use and the instructions which u wrote are what it does.
if and else=if is called a control statment that controls the flow of your program. e.g. if user selects blue color for the page then change the backround color to blue otherwise change the color to red
e.g.2if(the user chosses the color blue from the dropdown menu the color changes to blue) {						
			}else{                           						//this is saying that else
