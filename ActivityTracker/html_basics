HTML=Hyper Text Markup Language
	this html language is used to create web pages
	mark ups in HTML are HTML tags.The way you make an html tag is to write commands inside less than and greater then
	e.g.<html><head><script><body><title>
	EVERY TAG NEEDS TO BE COLSED. THE WAY YOU COLSE A TAG IS TO PUT A / BEFORE THE TAG AND THEN WRITE THE TAG
	e.g.</html></head></script></body></title>
	some tags do not need to be colsed as they are self closing tags
	e.g.<br/><img/><hr/>
	every tag can have additional instructions mentioned in the form of attributes
	attributes are witen inside a tag, after the tag name, in the form of attribute name followed by = followed by its vlue inside "
	e.g.<body bgcolor="red">this will change thr page color to red

		<tr>creats a row inside a table
